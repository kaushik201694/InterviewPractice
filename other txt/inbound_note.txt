create/Add new user in AD(name of the lab. for our dev team, the name of the lab is different) site --> then add that user in UCC --> then we can use that user in UAD

creating service in UCC for UAD to use it --> then we can assign a dnis number of this newly created service in Unified Director (inside "Numbering Plan" section)--> in UCC, we can add one or more agents to this service -->
after that once we login to the UAD by entering the credentials of a particular agent, we shall have 2 different ways to call this agent(inbound operation). The one being its own specific dnis number,
and the other being through the dnis number of the  service which we created. If the agent is idle, we can contact this agent via both of these dnis numbers.

I am a part of NFV team of Ericsson. Our team works on traffic steering module in EVR,ie, Ericsson Virtual Router.
In one sentence Taffic Steering invloves steering ingress traffic coming from LC to appropriate application instance
running VSFO/SSC cards.
SSC cards have intel processrors running in them. They have the power to run application instances in them.
But SSC cards dont have any physical port.
All the application traffic ingresses in and egresses out from the "normal" line cards.the thoughtput of these LCs are 
much greater than the SSC cards.
The application traffic ingressing though the LC, is need to be "steered" to right SSC card based on the application instance
that is running on it(SSC).

There are 2 steps involved in Traffic steering:
1)PAP configuration :-> Each application instance(say EPG) running on a SSC/VSFO is enabled with with a unique 
                        Packet Access Point (PAP) to recieve traffic.
2)TSM configuration :-> All the LC/SSC cards are provided with required 
                    “TSM-Traffic Slice Management ” configuration to steer the ingress traffic to the right PAP.
            
PAP configuration :->
------------------------
The Packet Access Point (PAP) is an endpoint that is opened by an application to send/receive packets in the SSC.
The PAP is identified by a unique 32bit value across the SSR chassis and this value is called the PAPID.  
This PAPID as defined and used by applications such as EPG and IPSEC comprises of three fields :
	1)slot_id --> implies to the specific slot to which the papid is binded.
	2)PAP_STYPE --> identifies the service type of the traffic that is expected to be received on the PAP endpoint.
	3)PAP_index --> identifies the hardware resources such as the Niantic port and queue used for the PAP endpoint.
	
 TSM APP 
TSM APP library is used by applications to configure one or more services through TSM APP API.

 TSM RP 
TSM RP is process running in RP to handle application configurations and TSM cli. TSM
RP also interact with TSM-FABL to download configuration from RP to linecard slots.

 TSM FABL
TSM FABL is process running in all linecard card and SSC card slots. This process
receives configuration from TSM RP and pass configuration to PFE through ALD.
